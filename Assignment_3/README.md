## Big Data Systems and Int Analytics Assignment 3

## Objective

The aim of this assignment is to get familiar with the gretel design and run the tutorials. Furthermore, the goal of this assignment is to implement a REST API to execute mse_model. This model takes 13 images as input and 12 images as output. The user will be able to get the predicted images as output after passing the required input parameters.

This repository contains data, lab work ,Design Document and source code of assignment3 which covers:

* Designing of API using FastAPI
* Providing Model as a Service
* Demonstration of API in a Python Notebook
* Handling all Edgecases using Testcases
